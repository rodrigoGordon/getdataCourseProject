#Getting and cleaning data - Course Project


##Study Design
The R analysis run on the Human Activity dataset, from the UC Irvine [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones ] repository.The tidy dataset was developed through the transformation/merge of the following datasets from UCI(they can be found at the *UCI HAR Dataset* folder):
    
    - X_train.txt - 7352 rows by 561 variables
    - X_test.txt - 2947 rows by 561 variables
    - y_train.txt - 7352 rows by 1 variable
    - y_test.txt - 2947 rows by 1 variable
    
The features in the raw datasets above were produced by, a study on Human Activity Recognition through the use of smartphones(SAMSUNG GALAXY SII), where subjects were asked to perform the set of activities:
    
    - WALKING
    - WALKING_UPSTAIRS
    - WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
    - SITTING
    - STANDING
    - LAYING

Which can be found at the activity_labels.txt inside the folder *UCI HAR Dataset*. Furthermore, the smartphone used, provided an Accelerometer and a Gyroscope, which were the basis to calculate the variable for the training and test sets. More informartion about the raw data can be found at *UCI HAR Dataset/features_info.txt* .

    
# Codebook - The Tidy dataset
The tidy dataset created, it's composed by 180 rows and 88 columns. Let's firstly describe the columns; Their names were generated firstly by changing the abbreviated expressions on raw data, to a more readable format, such as: tBodyAccMeanX turned into timeBodyAccelerometerMeanX.

This procedure it's equivalent for all features in this tidy dataset. Moreover, the exact 88 out 561 original columns, were selected through specification of only the features that calculated any mean or standard deviation for the specific matter/measurement. Following it's a brief description of each feature and its unit measure.

 - "descriptionOfActivityPerformed" - Represents the activity that was being performed by the time of measurement. It's classified as: *WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING*, and it comes from the dataset: *activity_labels.txt*.  The factor levels were calculated by comparing the *y_train.txt* and *y_test.txt* with *activity_labels.txt*.
 
 - "subjectID" - Represents the identification for a subject in the dataset. Its unit goes from 1 to 30, since the experiment was performed with 30 people. It was defined from both datasets: *subject_train.txt* and *subject_test.txt*.
 
The following description it's equivalement to all the remaining variables:
  *They were generated by the Accelerometer and Gyroscope on the device used to measure the activity. Their calculation represent either the mean or standard deviation for the specific matter*

#### The rows
They represent individual measurements for each subject; Thus, one row informs about a specific activity performed by a specific subject with the set of measurements with frequency, time, angle, etc.
